This is an autocorrect, it checks for possible spelling mistakes, if it cannot find a word in its dictionary
then it delete's a letter, inserts a letter, swaps letters, and replaces letters with keys next to a key
on the keyboard to look for possible replacements, it outputs the amount of possible replacements and at most
the three most common replacements. The file words.txt from where it gets its words is not expansive and does not
include all the words in the English language so this autocorrect is not expansive. words.txt and keyboard.txt
need to be in the same folder as this program for it to work. input.txt is not needed for this to run, it is just
an example of a valid input file.
